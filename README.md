## Introduction: 
      Here are some lessons learned and working approaches after many trials-and-errors to build tensor flow experiment virtual environments on Mac OSX. The built playgrounds should be able to experiment with various input / output interactively. Many online articles and FAQs are actually not working correctly, at least on my MacBook. 
      Two kinds of virtual environments are verified, 
        (1) python virtual environment
        (2) docker/container
      This one covers two specific parts:
        (1) a tensorflow container with novnc, so that X11 GUI is accessible via browser. 
        (2) a tensorflow container with ffmpeg, so that matplotlib animation could embed on Jupyter notebook. 
        
      Appendix section contains other verified working alternatives.  

### Setup the container with X11 GUI on browser
        docker pull quay.io/draft/tensorflow-novnc
        docker run -v $PWD:/source -d -p 8080:8080 quay.io/draft/tensorflow-novnc
        open http://localhost:8080/vnc.html

        // It might be easier to experiment with CLI and see the output figures on browser altogether
        docker exec -it <tensorflow-novnc container id> bash

### Setup the container with matplotlib animation on Jupyter notebook
        docker pull quay.io/draft/tensorflow-ffmpeg
        docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -v ${PWD}:/source --rm quay.io/draft/tensorflow-ffmpeg
        // remember to add followings to embed matplotlib animations
            (1) %matplotlib inline
            (2) from matplotlib import rc
            (3) from IPython.display import HTML
            (4) rc('animation', html='html5') 
	            ...
            (5) type <your_animation_variable> in a new cell // it will show the embedded animation video

            Note: refer to

## Appendix:
#### 1. Python virutal environment 
    (1) install specific python version:
        brew update
        brew install pyenv 
        brew install pyenv-virtualenv
        pyenv install 3.5.2  // install Python 3.5.2
        
    (2) create a virtual environment and activate it:
        eval "$(pyenv init -)" // add this line to ~/.bash_profile if needed
        pyenv virtualenv 3.5.2 tf-py352  // create virtual environment (tf-py352) with Python 3.5.2
        pyenv activate tf-py352 // activate tf-py352 virtual environment
        
        Related commands:
        pyenv deactivate <virtual-env> // deactivate specified virtual environment
        pyenv uninstall <virtual-env> // delete specified virtual environment
        pyenv versions // list installed python versions
        pyenv virtualenvs // list created virtual environments

    (3) install libraries/modules within virtual environment:
    	brew install freetype   // prerequisite of matplotlib
        pip install numpy matplotlib ipython jupyter opencv-python
        export TF_BINARY_URL=https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-0.10.0rc0-py3-none-any.whl
        pip install --upgrade $TF_BINARY_URL
        
    (4) setup matplotlib backends on Mac:
        // get matplotlib configuration file place
        >>> import matplotlib
        >>> matplotlib.matplotlib_fname()
        // change backend to TkAgg via editor
        
        Notes:
        <1> default backend "macos" doesn't work with python virtual environments. furthermore, the workarounds listed on matplotlib.org's FAQ don't work as well. (http://matplotlib.org/faq/virtualenv_faq.html)
        <2> backend "Qt4Agg" doesn't work as well. To use it, it's needed to have PySide, which will take quite a long time to build. Even worse, after time/space spent for setup build environment/tool (Xcode w/ right SDK version) and built it successfully, it just still not work...
    
    (5) experiment with python: 
        // when use matplotlib.pyplot, its output will show on an interactive window 
        
    (6) experiment with ipython:
        // when use matplotlib.pyplot, its output will show on an interactive window
        
    (7) experiment with jupyter notebook:
        jupyter notebook // show a new tab for the notebook on the default browser 
        // if you'd like the output figure shown inlined instead of a pop out interactive window, you should add following line.
        %matplotlib inline

        Note:
        As mentioned earlier in "Setup the container with matplotlib animation on Jupyter notebook" section, it needs extra steps to embed matplotlib animation on Jupyter notebook.
        brew install ffmpeg // install ffmpeg on mac
        
        // remember to add followings to embed matplotlib animations
        (1) %matplotlib inline
        (2) from matplotlib import rc
        (3) from IPython.display import HTML
        (4) rc('animation', html='html5') 
	            ...
        (5) type <your_animation_variable> in a new cell // it will show the embedded animation video
        
#### 2. Docker/container:
    (1) download official tensor flow Docker image & launch it:
        docker pull gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow
        <1> Jupyter notebook
            docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -v ${PWD}:/source --rm gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow
            // remember to add "%matplotlib inline" to show matplotlib figures
            
        <2> CLI
            docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -v ${PWD}:/source --rm --entrypoint bash gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow
            // can not show matplotlib figures
            
    (2) download custom Docker image with tensor flow & novnc:
        // customize official docker image by adding novnc, to enable X11 GUI access via browser
        // refer to earlier "Setup the container with X11 GUI on browser" section

#### 3. Debugging Python Code
* VSCode is quite convenient for debugging Python code. For VSCode python code debugging in Python virtual environment, just launch VSCode in the command line under the activated python virtual environment. 

		Winstonteki-MacBook-Air:notebook Winston$ pyenv activate tf-p35
		(tf-p35) Winstonteki-MacBook-Air:notebook Winston$ code ~/GitHub/tensorflow_playground/notebook/

#### 4. Python/Jupyter on Raspberry pi
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev python-opencv
$ sudo pip install jupyter 
```
* Refer to http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/public_server.html for setup jupyter notebook server, however, 
it works via http, but seems not work via https (not able to connect to kernel)
